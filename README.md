- Lab 1:
  - Problem 1: The Block Game
    - A set of wooden blocks of various shapes and colors are sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved.
  - Problem 2: Adversarial Board game
    - The game is played on a m*n grid board, where two players take turns to make moves. The objective of the game is to create a path to the opposite end of the board while blocking the opponent's path.
  - Problem 3: Solving Wordoku
    - Implement an AI agent to solve the Wordoku puzzle game. The core technique to focus is the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). You will be implementing two methods to solve the Wordoku puzzle and compare the implementations. Wordoku is an extension of Sudoku where we have alphabets in place of digits. Some basics about the CSP approach for solving the same are given below.
   
- Lab 2:
  - Problem 1: Gibbs Sampling
    - Consider a data set on the heights of 695 women and 562 men. Suppose we have the list of heights, but we don’t know which data points are from women and which are from men. The data points are available in Heights.csv. The combined distribution of all 1257 heights. Perform Gibbs Sampling on given dataset.
  - Problem 2: Particle Filter Simulation for Robot Localization
    - A traveller needs to locate its beloved robot in an unkwown city, but luckly he has a tool that provides the data from the sensors of the robot, but the sensors are not perfect and can provide noisy measurements (the noise information is provided in the code below). Your task is to help the traveller by implementing a Particle Filter algorithm to accurately localize the zone of the robot within the city.
  - Problem 3: X-Men MDP
    - Most of the X-Men are mutants, a subspecies of humans who are born with superhuman abilities activated by the "X-Gene". In this question, you will use some algorithms to compute optimal policies in Markov decision processes (MDP’s) to help wolverine escape from Magneto while trying to find Jean in order to kill her.
